## Overview

- `OpenCore`   OpenCore' s version is 0.6.5, It's base on the [Acidanthera](https://github.com/acidanthera)'s offical [Release](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases), theoretically I will update to the latest version of OC in a week after it is released.

- `EFI-iGPU` used when the Desktop iGPU is used to drive a display.

- `EFI-dGPU` used when the Desktop iGPU is only used for computing tasks and doesn't drive a display. 

  - If you are using AMD RX500 series graphics CARDS (such as RX580, RX570, RX560, etc.), you can add the [`RadeonBoost.kext`](https://github.com/WenvyG/ASRock-B460M-ITX-ac-Hackintosh/tree/main/RadeonBoost.kext) in `EFI` --`OC`--`Kexts`, which will theoretically make the graphics card perform better. **And it can be used normally without it.**
  - If you are using Navi core RX5000 series graphics CARDS (such as RX5700(XT), RX5600(XT), RX5500(XT)), you need to include the **agdpmod=pikera** parameter under `NVRAM`-- `Add`--`7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82`--`boot-args` to prevent the screen from going black during boot.

  ##### PS. 

  ##### 1. `OC 0.6.5 now is support to install macOS Big Sur to your disk, it's a good news for Hackintosh. Enjoy it!`

  #### 2.I prefer to use [`ProperTree`](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) when you are editing config.plist.
